The tool has been built with [http://processing.org Processing] (v0135, but other recent versions should be fine too) and furthermore requires the following libraries:

  * [http://toxiclibs.googlecode.com toxiclibs]:
    * [http://toxiclibs.googlecode.com/files/toxiclibscore-0014.zip toxiclibscore-0014.zip] (or newer) subpackage
    * [http://toxiclibs.googlecode.com/files/verletphysics-0004.zip verletphysics-0004] (or newer) subpackage
  * [http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/ ControlP5 0.2.11] (or newer) GUI library

The code should be straight forward, but isn't very well documented at the moment... am working on this.
